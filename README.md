# Genetic-Algorithm-ANN-Navegation-Robot
A genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize hyperparameters for an artificial neural network tasked with the navigation of a Wall-Following Robot. This endeavor was driven by the hypothesis that the apparent simplicity of the navigation task belied its non-linear separability. 

The dataset employed to test this hypothesis, demonstrated the limitations of linear classifiers like the Perceptron network in successfully learning the task and preventing collisions. Conversely, nonlinear neural classifiers, notably MLP networks, exhibited proficiency in navigating the simulated environment without incidents. 

The genetic algorithm played a pivotal role in refining parameters such as layer count, neuron quantity, learning rate, and optimizer type, underscoring its efficacy in tackling intricate nonlinear classification challenges. This project marks a significant stride at the nexus of robotics and machine learning, revealing compelling insights into the complexities of seemingly straightforward tasks.
